# Profile

I have always had a general interest in tech and, since I started to delve in to software development, I've found it occupies the perfect bridge between logical rational and artistic license, that suits me down to a tee.
I have demonstrable experience excelling in large or small projects across a variety of disciplines and I strive to best utilise the skills I have or leverage my adaptability to expand upon them.
